Lets Learn Python3

This is going to be one of the hardest things that I have ever commited to trying to learn on my own. Hopefully you will look back at this and see how far you have come and how much you have learned. Keep your mind right and keep pushing forward. 
This is starting with learning a little about GitHub and then moving on to learning Python3 and then hopefully get more into CTF (Capture the Flag) and from there into possibly bug bounty programs. Make sure to learn the basics and then build from there!
